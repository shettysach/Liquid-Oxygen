## liquid-oxygen

A tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, based on the first half of the book, Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystorm.

### Cabal

#### REPL

```sh
cabal run liquid-oxygen
```

#### Interpret script

cabal run liquid-oxygen <script>
```

### Notes:

#### Map vs HashMap
- Implementation - `HashMap` `(amortized O(1))` would be faster than `Map` `(O(log n))` for variable lookup since variable names don't need ordering, but I chose `Map` because `HashMap` is external (`unordered-containers`), whereas `Map` is in base/containers. 
- Might change this later, as it seems like a drop-in replacement.

#### Resolving
- The original implementation uses a `locals` map to track only local variable resolutions.
- My implementation uses `distances`, which uniformly tracks local and global by their scope depth.

#### Initialize vs Assign
- Only `modifyIORef` (lazy) works for `initialize` due to Functions, because closures depend on lazily init envs and may involve cyclic refs (`mdo` / `fixIO`).
- `atomicModifyIORef` (strict) seems to work safely for `assignAt`, since assignment happens after eval and does not involve cyclic structs.
